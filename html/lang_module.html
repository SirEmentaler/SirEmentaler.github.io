<h1>Script modules</h1>
<p>An AngelScript module is the result of successful script compilation. It is a collection of script functions, classes, variables, and other entities, all of which may be inseparable and mutually dependant. In JJ2+, a module may either be assigned to a specific level or be a mutator.</p>
<p>A script module is generated by an AngelScript compiler from human-readable source code. In case of JJ2+, this source code is obtained from files, typically stored in the game directory. A single JJ2+ module is built from the contents of one or more files.</p>
<p>Multiple modules may exist in the same application at the same time. By default, different modules do not have any entities in common and are independent from each other, aside from interacting with the same application. However, it is possible to <a href="#lang_shared">share</a> some entities between modules, or to <a href="#lang_import">import</a> functions from another module, which, together with mechanisms provided by the application, allows modules to interact and communicate with each other.</p>
